Version numbering:
Major - data store format
Minor - incompatible API changes
Release - fixes, performance improvement, API additions

0.9.12 - Unload and deletion now work under exclusive lock, if allowed by lock mode. Unlink remove exclusive lock and revert to disk copy such lock if exists.
        Added flags SING_CF_UNLOAD_ON_CLOSE and SING_CF_KEEP_LOCK. Documentation fixes.

0.9.11 - Fixed bug with lock removing in multikeys reads. 
        Fixed work with phantoms in most api data calls. Added set of calls for working with phantoms. Added many tests for phantom keys and values.
        Added work with single keys in sing_handler. Documentation fixes.

0.9.10 - Fixed work with phantom values. Key now can containt both phantom and normal values, phantom stored in extra_bytes. In this case
        both values has phantom flag setted. Deleted key with no actual value still marked with diff_mark. This allow concatenation of
        diffs without overwriting changes. Flag use_phantom in tdata allow overwrite phantom behavior and perform normal deleting or replacing
        phantom keys
        Fixed bug in get_values_simple. Tests updated.
        Fixed bug in sing_handler in diff with replace operation

0.9.9 - Fixed issues with incosistent reading and writing during idx_revert. 
        SING_LM_NONE now has no write locks at all, but SING_LM_FAST has normal write lock. sing_lockRW deleted, because it is unsafe. 
        Documentation fixed.
        idx_create no longer damage existing set, and has normal rollback in case of failure.

0.9.8 - pipelines separated from file parsing. Added file parsing tests. Added lost multikey read calls and multikey write calls.
        Added multikey write calls tests. Some api and documentation fixes

0.9.7 - fixed bug with log based value size index, and related test. Fixed bug in locks test and in idx_key_set call.

0.9.6 - sing_intersect_file and sing_intersect_replace_file no more generate output file, data can be dumped later if needed.
        sing_dump is now safe for concurent deletion. sing_iterate is write call, but can work in SING_LM_READ_ONLY mode without modifications
        Api and documentation fixes.

0.9.5 - sing_dump is a safe reader call now. Reworked filebuffer.c. API tests splitted to different files. Added tests for read and write file buffers. 
        Big structures moved from stack to heap allocation. Keeped reader locks now is keeped even in case of pending write (with switched mask).

0.9.4 - fixed improper use of second thread for file parsing in diff in sing_handler

0.9.3 - fixed bug in counters based diff. Fixed bug in lck_processUnlock. Api and documentation fixes 

0.9.2 - fixed name of flag SING_CF_READER. Fixed bug in file buffers initialization. 

0.9.1 - added some api tests, minor api and documentation fixes. Autorevert in LM_SIMPLE now works for comples API calls only, 
        it should be nothing to do in simple calls

0.9.0 - code was getted from internal repository with some adaptations, may be fixes in the code or documentation are needed. 
        Documentation is a project for the 1.0.0 release version, and may be different from real API.
